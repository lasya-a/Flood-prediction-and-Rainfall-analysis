# Flood-prediction-and-Rainfall-analysis
This project can be easily used to predict the occurrence of flood beforehand .Prediction of flood is done by analyzing using previous data, map the flood concentration. Machine learning algorithms are used to build the model. Machine learning techniques enable us to process and analyze large datasets from various sources, making it easier to predict rainfall patterns and anticipate potential flood events. By this model urban flooding in major cities can be known well in advance and the various disaster management departments and people can be prepared to face the floods
